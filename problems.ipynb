    "<h1>Problem 1: Generating Random Boolean Functions</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is designed to work with Boolean functions - functions that take Boolean inputs (True/False) and return a Boolean output. For this problem, we're dealing with functions that take 4 Boolean arguments as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions are guaranteed to be one of two types. A constant function always returns the same value no matter what inputs you give it - either it always returns True, or it always returns False. A balanced function returns True for exactly half of the possible input combinations and False for the other half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have 4 Boolean inputs, there are 16 possible combinations of inputs (2^4 = 16). This means a balanced function will return True for 8 of those combinations and False for the other 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "For constant functions, there are only 2 possibilities - the always-True function and the always-False function. For balanced functions, there are many more possibilities since we need to choose which 8 inputs return True.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem is to write a Python function that randomly generates one of these constant or balanced functions and returns it so it can be called and tested."
